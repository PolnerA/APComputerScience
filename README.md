# APComputerScience
This repo contains all my projects that I worked on in AP Computer Science A my Sophomore year.
It also contains the 1st and 2nd goal sheets which I used to learn Java.
Along with the Recursion goal sheet in the recursion folder helping me understand recursion.
key projects in this repo are:
Graphing Calculator 
    this is an RPN graphing calculator that is pretty in depth, deserving of its own repository
    this project led me to learn about derivatives, along with useful tools like the
    implementation of a recursive tree for functions as it culminated in me creating my
    own programming language as it shows the user input (code) after a compilation.
Sorting Algorithms
    this project displays different sorting algorithms by pressing different keys (m for merge,
    b for bubble, q for quick etc.) the keybinds can be found in the code comments and in the application. 
    it shows a bunch of white bars representing numbers that eventually fall into place as they are sorted.
Levenshtein
    this project showcases changes in words like cat->cot->cog->dog by implementing a depth first search.
    it also uses hashsets to make it run efficiently.
Wordle
    a version of the daily game that picks a random word and the player has to guess it.
